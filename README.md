This repository contains the AI Agents Assignment, which requires demonstrating comprehensive understanding of AI Agents, their development frameworks, applications across industries, business implications, and future challenges. The assignment includes analyzing theoretical concepts, evaluating practical implementations, and proposing innovative solutions using AI Agent technology.

The assignment is divided into two main sections:
- **Section 1: Short Answer Questions** - Covering topics such as comparison of LangChain and AutoGen frameworks, transformation of supply chain management, Human-Agent Symbiosis, ethical implications in finance, and technical challenges in memory and state management.
- **Section 2: Case Study Analysis** - Focusing on implementing AI Agents at AutoParts Inc. for smart manufacturing, including strategy proposal, ROI analysis, risk mitigation, and simulation.

The answers to the assignment are provided in `AI Agents Answers.pdf`.
